# HTML lab: Coppa Club

![Coppa Club](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3531085/22377394/9b49b1c0-e4a9-11e6-8d61-f8ff532c55fe.png)


[Coppa Club Tower Bridge](http://www.coppaclub.co.uk/towerbridge) is a typical single page website that you might see for a pub or restaurant.

Your goal is to deconstruct the image into _semantic_ HTML.

For this lab, you should focus on HTML. When you're happy with your HTML, start adding CSS to match the design.

The starter code is as follows:

```bash
├── images
│   ├── barman.jpg
│   ├── chef.jpg
│   ├── cocktail.jpg
│   ├── facebook.png
│   ├── gallery-image-1.jpg
│   ├── instagram.png
│   ├── logo-small.png
│   ├── logo_teal.svg
│   ├── map.png
│   └── twitter.png
└── index.html
```

> **Note:** Send out the starter-code and reference image `coppa-club-reference.png`. You should also demonstrate the solution.

All of the text is already in the `index.html`. All you need to do is put the correct content in well considered HTML elements.

## Tips

- Keep your markup minimal.
- You may find it useful to draw a diagram of the site to help you consider what each element should be.
- Don't worry about how the end result looks, this is all about HTML.
- Make sure you use the correct attributes for forms, buttons, links and images.
- Only use the images provided _(don't add all the gallery images)_.
- There is no right or wrong answer, we are looking for good _semantic_ markup. You should be able to justify your choice of elements.
- [MDN's HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) may be useful.
